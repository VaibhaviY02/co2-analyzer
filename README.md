# PROJECT - CO2 Emission Analyser

A simple beginner-friendly Python project that helps you calculate and track your personal CO2 emissions from transportation, energy usage, and food consumption.

## Overview of the Project

This project allows users to enter basic details like distance travelled, electricity consumed, or types of food eaten. Based on these inputs, the program calculates the total carbon footprint. It is designed in a simple and easy-to-understand way for beginners who want to learn Python and environmental data analysis.

## Features

- Add transportation emissions (car, bus, train, plane)
- Add energy usage (electricity, natural gas, etc.)
- Add food-related emissions
- View total emissions summary
- Visualize emissions using graphs
- Export results into a CSV file

## Technologies / Tools Used

- Python 3
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- CSV (for saving reports)
- Tkinter (GUI is used)
- Basic Python functions and lists

## Steps to Install and Run the Project

1. Install Python 3 on your system.
2. Download or clone the project repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt inside the project folder.
4. Install all required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Instructions for testing
1.Run the program and try entering different values for transportation, energy, and food.

2.Check if the total CO2 emission updates correctly after each input.

3.Test the “Visualize” option to see if the graph opens without errors.

4.Save a report as CSV and verify that the file is created properly.

5.Run the example file (example_usage.py) to confirm that all functions work as expected.

6.Try giving wrong inputs (like text instead of numbers) to see if error messages appear.
