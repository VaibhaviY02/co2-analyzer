 # Project Statement: CO2 Emission Analyzer

## 1. Problem Statement
CO₂ emission data is often scattered, raw, and difficult to interpret.
Stakeholders need:  A reproducible pipeline to ingest and clean disparate datasets. 
• Visual dashboards to explore historical trends and correlations. 
•  Simple prediction models to forecast short-term emission levels.  
• Lightweight, documented code and reproducible results for academic/demo use.

## 2. Scope of the Project
- The project focuses on calculating basic CO2 emissions based on user inputs.
- It covers three main areas: transportation, energy usage, and food consumption.
- The system can display total emissions, visualize them using graphs, and export data to a CSV file.
- The project is beginner-friendly and intended for learning purposes, not for industrial-level accuracy.

## 3. Target Users
- Students learning Python programming  
- Beginners in data analysis or environmental studies  
- Individuals interested in checking their personal carbon footprint  
- Developers who want a simple base project to build more advanced environmental tools  

## 4. High-Level Features
- Add and calculate emissions for transportation, energy, and food
- View total CO2 emissions in a simple summary
- Visualize emissions through basic graphs
- Export emission records into CSV format
- Simple structure for easy understanding and modification
