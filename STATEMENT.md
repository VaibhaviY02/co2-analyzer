 # Project Statement: CO2 Emission Analyzer

## 1. Problem Statement
With increasing environmental concerns, many people want to understand how their daily activities contribute to carbon emissions. However, there are very few simple tools available for beginners to calculate their personal CO2 footprint. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use Python-based solution that helps users track their emissions from transport, energy use, and food consumption.

## 2. Scope of the Project
- The project focuses on calculating basic CO2 emissions based on user inputs.
- It covers three main areas: transportation, energy usage, and food consumption.
- The system can display total emissions, visualize them using graphs, and export data to a CSV file.
- The project is beginner-friendly and intended for learning purposes, not for industrial-level accuracy.

## 3. Target Users
- Students learning Python programming  
- Beginners in data analysis or environmental studies  
- Individuals interested in checking their personal carbon footprint  
- Developers who want a simple base project to build more advanced environmental tools  

## 4. High-Level Features
- Add and calculate emissions for transportation, energy, and food
- View total CO2 emissions in a simple summary
- Visualize emissions through basic graphs
- Export emission records into CSV format
- Simple structure for easy understanding and modification
